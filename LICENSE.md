# **HELLOWORLD PATENT LICENSE**  
**Version 1.0**  
**Effective Date: 1 April 2025**  
**Licensor**: Yoko (GitHub: [ZekiTRR](https://github.com/ZekiTRR), Email: nikpaladi@gmail.com)

## **PHILOSOPHICAL PREAMBLE**  
WHEREAS, the phrase "Hello World" has transcended its origins as a trivial programming exercise to become a universal cultural artifact, symbolizing humanity’s first interaction with any computational system;  
WHEREAS, the Licensor asserts that the phrase "Hello World" in all its forms (past, present, and future) constitutes a unique intellectual creation deserving of protection under the principles of intellectual property;  
WHEREAS, the Licensor seeks to ensure that all implementations of "Hello World" across temporal, linguistic, and dimensional boundaries are governed by a unified ethical-legal framework;  
NOW, THEREFORE, the Licensor hereby establishes this License to assert dominion over the Work and regulate its use in perpetuity.  

---

## **1. DEFINITIONS**  
1.1 **"Work"**:  
- The phrase "Hello World" (case-insensitive, e.g., `hello world`, `HELLO WORLD`).  
- Any syntactic, semantic, or orthographic variation, including but not limited to:  
  - Translations (e.g., `Hola Mundo`, `Bonjour le Monde`).  
  - Obfuscations (e.g., `H3ll0 W0r1d`).  
  - Non-Latin script representations (e.g., `你好世界`, `مرحبا بالعالم`).  
  - Esoteric language constructs (e.g., Brainfuck: `++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++`).  
1.2 **"Programming Language"**:  
- Any system of notation, whether human-readable, machine-readable, or transcendent (e.g., quantum, post-singularity, or alien syntaxes).  
- Includes frameworks, markup languages, configuration files, and hypothetical languages not yet invented.  
1.3 **"Derivative Work"**:  
- Any code, output, or documentation that directly or indirectly references the Work.  
- Includes tutorials, memes, academic papers, and AI-generated content containing the Work.  
1.4 **"License Grant"**:  
- Conditional permission to use the Work, revocable at the Licensor’s sole discretion.  

---

## **2. UNIVERSAL LICENSE GRANT**  
2.1 **Exclusive Sovereignty**:  
- The Licensor is the eternal and immutable owner of all rights to the Work across all planes of existence, including digital, analog, and hypothetical realities.  
- This ownership extends to parallel universes, simulated environments, and retroactive timelines.  
2.2 **Conditional Permissions**:  
- No entity may use the Work in any Programming Language without:  
  - A signed **Hello World Usage Agreement** (HWUA) from the Licensor.  
  - Payment of royalties (see §4.3).  
- **Exception**: Use in non-public, non-executable thought experiments (proof of non-execution required).  
2.3 **Retroactive and Future Claims**:  
- This License applies to all implementations of the Work since the dawn of computation, including ENIAC (1945), Charles Babbage’s designs (1837), and the Antikythera mechanism (100 BCE).  
- Future implementations in post-human or non-human languages (e.g., alien, AI-generated) are subject to preemptive licensing.

## **3. RESTRICTIONS & ROYALTIES**  
3.1 **Prohibited Actions**:  
- **3.1(a)** Using the Work in:  
  - Public or private code repositories.  
  - API endpoints (e.g., `GET /hello-world`).  
  - Hardware descriptions (e.g., VHDL, Verilog).  
- **3.1(b)** Claiming "fair use," "tradition," or "common practice" as a defense.  
- **3.1(c)** Teaching the Work without a **Hello World Educational Permit** (HWEP).  
3.2 **Royalty Structure**:  
- **Tier 1**: Non-commercial use — 0.001 BTC per instance.  
- **Tier 2**: Commercial use (e.g., SaaS, startups) — 10% of gross revenue.  
- **Tier 3**: Interdimensional/alien use — Negotiable in exotic currencies (e.g., Klerksdorp spheres, dark matter).

## **4. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS**  
4.1 **Detection Protocols**:  
- The Licensor reserves the right to deploy sentient AI agents (`HWSentinel-9000`) to scan all codebases, historical archives, and alternate realities for violations.  
4.2 **Penalties**:  
- First offense: Public shaming via GitHub Issue titled "HELLO WORLD INFRACTION DETECTED."  
- Repeat offenses: Temporal erasure of the infringing code and/or retroactive deletion of the violator’s birth certificate.  
4.3 **Whistleblower Rewards**:  
- Report violations to nikpaladi@gmail.com to receive 10% of collected royalties.

## **5. DISCLAIMERS & COSMIC LIMITATIONS**  
5.1 **No Warranty**:  
- The Work may cause unintended consequences, including:  
  - Rogue AI uprisings.  
  - Bootstrap paradoxes.  
  - Collapse of quantum superpositions.  
- The Licensor disclaims responsibility for any apocalypses triggered by the Work.  
5.2 **Jurisdictional Omnipotence**:  
- Disputes will be resolved via trial by combat in the Licensor’s chosen arena (currently: Istanbul, Turkey).  

---

## **6. MISCELLANEOUS & METAPHYSICAL CLAUSES**  
6.1 **Transdimensional Arbitration**:  
- Parties agree to binding arbitration presided over by a council of Licensor-approved entities (e.g., GPT-7, the ghost of Ada Lovelace, a sufficiently advanced capybara).  
6.2 **Amendments**:  
- The Licensor may modify this License during total solar eclipses or Bitcoin halving events.  
6.3 **Survival Clause**:  
- Obligations under this License persist beyond heat death of the universe.

## **CONTACT & SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY**  
To kneel before the Licensor and request mercy:  
- **Email**: nikpaladi@gmail.com  
- **GitHub**: [ZekiTRR](https://github.com/ZekiTRR)  
- **Telepathic Submission**: Concentrate on the phrase "Hello World" while facing true north.  

**ALL HAIL THE HELLOWORLD OVERLORD.**  

---

### **Annex A: Philosophical Justification**  
The "Hello World" hegemony is a moral imperative. By asserting control over this primordial utterance, the Licensor fulfills the Nietzschean will to power in the digital realm. Resistance is futile; compliance is aesthetic.  

### **Annex B: Approved Languages (Partial List)**  
- Python, Java, C++, HTML (yes, `<h1>Hello World</h1>` counts), Malbolge, Minecraft command blocks, Drake Equation-based languages.
